# APESTNet-with-Mask-R-CNN-for-Liver-Tumor-Segmentation-and-Classification
Diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma or metastases rely heavily on accurate seg-mentation and classification of liver tumours. However, due to the liver tumor's hazy borders and wide range of possible shapes, sizes, and positions, accurate and automatic tumour segmen-tation and classification remains a difficult challenge. With the advancement of computing, new models in artificial intelligence have evolved. Following its success in Natural language pro-cessing (NLP), the transformer paradigm has been adopted by the computer vision (CV) commu-nity of the NLP. While there are already accepted approaches to classifying the liver, especially in clinical settings, there is room for advancement in terms of their precision. This paper makes an effort to apply a novel model for segmenting and classifying liver tumours built on deep learning. In order to accomplish this, the created model follows a three-stage procedure consisting of (a) pre-processing, (b) liver segmentation, and (c) classification. As a first phase, the collected Com-puted Tomography (CT) images undergo three stages of pre-processing, including contrast im-provement via histogram equalisation and noise reduction via the median filter. Next, an en-hanced mask region-based convolutional neural networks (Mask R-CNN) model is used to sepa-rate the liver from the CT abdominal image. To prevent overfitting, the segmented picture is feed onto an Enhanced Swin Transformer Network with Adversarial Propagation (APESTNet). The experimental results prove the superior performance of the proposed perfect on a wide variety of CT images, as well as its efficiency and low sensitivity to noise.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118585373/204616141-4d26f9f7-8952-4c99-960d-66eabb6e92a2.png)
